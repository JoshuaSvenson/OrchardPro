    Description: This hook is called whenever an item in your options menu is selected. The default implementation
                simply returns false to have the normal processing happen (calling the item's Runnable or sending
                a message to its Handler as appropriate). You can use this method for any items for which you would
                like to do processing without those other facilities.
    Parameters: MenuItem item - The menu item that was selected.
    Returns: boolean - Return false to allow normal menu processing to proceed, true to consume it here.

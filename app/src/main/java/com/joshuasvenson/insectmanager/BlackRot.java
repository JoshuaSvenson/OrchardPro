                "obtusa. Begin checking your apple trees for signs of infection about a week after the petals " +
                "fall from your apple blossoms. \n\nEarly symptoms are often limited to leaf symptoms such as purple " +
                "spots on upper leaf surfaces. As these spots age, the margins remain purple, but the centers dry " +
                "out and turn yellow to brown. Over time, the spots expand and heavily infected leaves drop from the " +

    Description: This hook is called whenever an item in your options menu is selected. The default implementation
                simply returns false to have the normal processing happen (calling the item's Runnable or sending
                a message to its Handler as appropriate). You can use this method for any items for which you would
                like to do processing without those other facilities.
    Parameters: MenuItem item - The menu item that was selected.
    Returns: boolean - Return false to allow normal menu processing to proceed, true to consume it here.
